## Project Overview

This is a interactive web-based quiz application built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to test their knowledge on various topics with a clean user interface, real-time feedback, and a timer for added challenge.

## Features

* **Dynamic Question & Options Display:** Questions and their respective answer options are dynamically loaded and displayed.
* **Question Shuffling:** Questions are shuffled randomly for a fresh experience every time.
* **Interactive Timer:** Each question has a time limit, adding an element of challenge. The quiz automatically proceeds if time runs out.
* **Instant Feedback:** Users receive immediate visual feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect) on their selected answer.
* **Score Tracking:** Tracks correct and incorrect answers throughout the quiz, displaying the final score at the end.
* **Clear Reset Functionality:** Easily restart the quiz or return to the category selection screen.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Quiz data is stored in a separate JavaScript file for better organization and scalability.
